I have a few projects I would like to post on this site.

## Interactive plots of electron orbitals in a hydrogen atom.
Specifically, I would like relate this to our understanding of the process of emission and absorption of light. It turns out, that an engineer's understanding of radio antennas can be directly translated to understanding how atoms emit light. These interactive plots should make that clearer.

## Fixing up an old record player
I have in my possession an old record player that I will be fixing up soon. I'll have a few posts about taking it apart and putting it back together.

## Fun with FPGAs and optics
To be described later!
