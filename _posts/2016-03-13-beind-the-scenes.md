title: Behind the scenes

This page is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is an awesome way to create static web pages with little configuration. It is also blog-aware. The best thing about having a website built on Jekyll is that you can host it on literally any webserver. It does not require any serverside code to run. You can even host your own Jekyll powered website on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Feel free to fork (copy) my website [on github](https://github.com/hmaarrfk/hmaarrfk.github.io).

Theming (the pretty colors and nice fonts) is done using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/).
