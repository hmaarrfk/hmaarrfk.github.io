title: The HTTPS Dilemma

---

I fully acknowledge that hosting this website using plain text or http leads to some SERIOUS
privacy concerns. While at one point, I did get the website up and running on
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), I decided that I prefer the convenience of having all my code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/). For those of you seriously concerned about privacy, you may choose
to browse my website on [Github's inteface](https://github.com/hmaarrfk/hmaarrfk.github.io). You
may browse the `_posts` section.

I promise to make an effort of moving this website toward https once github supports it for custom
domains. There is a long [thread](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156) about it that
doesn't seem to be getting any attention from the people who matter.

I know current workarounds exist using
[Cloudflare](https://sheharyar.me/blog/free-ssl-for-github-pages-with-custom-domains/), but I would
rather let you make the choice on what VPN to use to access this website.
