## Welcome
Welcome to my homepage.
It is currently under heavy development.

I'm hoping to have information on here about myself, my research at Caltech, and various hobbies of mine.

## Contact me
The best way to contact me is through email.

## Technology behind this page

This page is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is an awesome way to create static web pages with little configuration. It is also blog-aware. The best thing about having a website built on Jekyll is that you can host it on literally any webserver. It does not require any serverside code to run. You can even host your own Jekyll powered website on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Feel free to fork (copy) my website [on github](https://github.com/hmaarrfk/hmaarrfk.github.io).

Theming (the pretty colors and nice fonts) is done using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/).
