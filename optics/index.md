# Optics

I do a lot of work with optics and learn interesting things everyday. I find many people fear optics because they think it is complicated.  In fact, many parallels exist between optics and radio waves. The major difference, which makes optics rather interesting, is that we are only able to directly measure the intensity of the wave in optics. Much of the research in optics is therefore focused on controlling the phase of the wave which cannot be measured directly.
