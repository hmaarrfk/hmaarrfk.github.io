title: My research

---
I'm current working as a graduate student under the supervision of Professor Yariv at the California Institute of Technology.

This page will soon contain info about my research. For the time being, I work on a variety of projects.

  1. 3D imaging using swept frequency lasers.
  2. Compressive sensing with applications to optics and imaging.
  3. Biosensing using optical resonators and swept frequency lasers.
  4. High power amplifiers.
  5. High coherence semiconductor lasers.

Hopefully I will have a page (and paper) on each of these topics soon.

For now, you can visit our group [website](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~aphyariv/) for more information.

Wow, a website that still uses frames!!! Maybe one day I'll work on updating it :D.
